# Build and Deploy

## Build

The _npm script_ in the AppRun Site app to compile and bundle is:

```sh
npm run build
```

All the code and assets are built into the **public** directory.

## Deploy

AppRun Site apps are client-side apps. All code runs in the browsers. There is no server-side app needed. The deployment is to copy the  **public** directory to the web server.
